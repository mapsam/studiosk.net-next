    <p><strong>Studio Skaggs Kennedy</strong> is a Berkeley-based design practice for architecture and urbanism, licensed in California and Washington state. Maxine Skaggs Kennedy and Sean Kennedy founded their studio in 2015. The practice is run as a studio in which study, research and collaboration are vitally important to the approach of design. Design is seen as a vigorous interaction with place at all scales and with all disciplines.</p>
