Studio_sk in partnership with <a href="http://www.warrenoffice.com/" target="_blank">WORD</a>, competed for the commission of a major new arts center in Moscow. The design for the 450,000 sf facility centered on the accommodation of a future permanent collection and the staging of major temporary exhibitions of contemporary Russian art.

The juxtaposition in program is reflected in the massing of the building and also in the path of circulation through the building. Two major routes through the building allow visitors to either circulate through the various galleries from floor to floor or take the M-art, a gallery sized diagonal elevator traversing the major public program traversing from street level to a top floor restaurant bar overlooking the city. This moving art gallery will house current Russian art, art from the other NCCA locations or private collections for public view as well as hosting special events. The presence of current Russian art with that of the permanent collection leads to multiple curatorial possibilities and readings as the collection evolves and grows.
