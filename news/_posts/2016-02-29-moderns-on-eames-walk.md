Construction begins on phase 2 of continuing development in the new Bridge District Neighborhood of West Sacramento. Consisting of 21 homes ranging in size from 1,500 - 2,500 SF. Arranged in differing types from city units to riverfront terraces to homes surrounding a central green - the dwellings are designed to relate directly to adjacent outdoor spaces, connect to the growing urban realm and provide space, light and city views for their inhabitants. <a href="http://www.moderns-tbd.com/Moderns-on-Eames-Walk/" target="_blank">www.moderns-tbd.com/Moderns-on-Eames-Walk/</a>
