Located in the forested hills of Oakland, the project is an addition, remodel and creation of an accessory dwelling along with landscape improvements to an existing mid-century modern house. The design seeks to enhance the strengths of the existing house â€“ including strong connections to rear pool landscape and views of Mount Diablo to views of the San Francisco Bay out the front windows. Removal of interior walls and non-functional program as well as remodeling the existing kitchen, dining, and living areas serves to create an open and light filled space to entertain, to relax and to take advantage of this ridgetop site.
