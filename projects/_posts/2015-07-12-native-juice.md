SSK designed the flagship store for a new juice and health food café in the Financial District of San Francisco. Centered around a functional hydroponic plant wall - “wall to table” - the project is designed as a clean and airy space within the busy neighborhood. Finishes are common materials used in ways which give them a defined and more refined appearance – contrasting with the simple white walls and honed concrete floors. The food and the space blend to make a modern atmosphere meant to sooth and refresh.
