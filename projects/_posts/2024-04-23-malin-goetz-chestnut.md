(Malin + Goetz) opens a 2nd San Francisco store in the Marina neighborhood. The space makes the most of a small, high ceiling retail space on Chestnut Street. The design partially removed an existing mezzanine to allow the showroom space to take advantage of the 15â€™ ceilings and tall north facing windows. The height of the space is further accentuated by a series of vertical plywood ribs along the product display walls. These walls have integrated adjustable shelving while a simple block island forms the point of sale and customer washbasin.
