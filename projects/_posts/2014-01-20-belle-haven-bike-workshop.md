The Belle Haven Bike Shop is a youth run bike repair and training project built from three repurposed shipping containers for the Belle Haven chapter of the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Peninsula. The bike shop will serve as both a community gathering space and an employment pathway for teens to jobs in local bike shops, transportation departments at local technology partners, and as certified instructors prepared to teach bicycle safety to both children and adults.

One 40 foot container consists of the bike workshop and storage which is connected to a 2nd vertical container. This tower will catch natural light through a skylight at the top end and serve as a beacon and landmark for the community. This urban marker will be visible from the nearby pedestrian bridge crossing a major freeway and which connects the community to a larger network of bike paths. The last container houses a flex space for a variety of diverse events including a DJ booth and bike blender smoothie caf√©. All containers can be closed, partially open or fully open with large sliding doors.
