From Bay to Lagoon the Peacock Family Kitchen combines serious cooking, family room hangout, entertaining and outdoor
spaces into a large gathering space which better reflects the clients lifestyle – a place for family and friends.

The entry portal and the existing bay windows at the front of the house were redesigned to create built in storage kitchen eating area while expanding windows and access to light and views of the San Francisco Bay. At the rear of the house, facing the Peacock Gap Lagoon, large pocketing glass doors were added to remove barriers between interior and exterior deck, outdoor cooking and pool scape.

The new kitchen includes generous storage and beautiful marble countertops. The kitchen island serves as the home’s modern hearth – part food prep, buffet, and conversation piece. Behind the kitchen area is a mudroom and storage space which partia lly conceals the entrance to the garage and powder room area.
