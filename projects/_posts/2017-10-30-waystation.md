The conversion of a former gas station into a 2000 SF restaurant and beer garden on an 8000 SF site in the town of Fairfax. Emphasizing the existing indoor to outdoor connections of the former maintenance garage the space strives to provide an oasis and resting place for people in the town as well as the many day travelers biking, hiking and exploring the countryside of Marin County. The outdoor seating area is envisioned as a day and night gathering space surrounded by plantings crucial to beer making – hops, fields of barley and other herbal flora.
