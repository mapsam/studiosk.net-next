<a href="http://www.theplantcafe.com/" target="_blank">The Plant’s</a> newest location provides a casual restaurant space on the San Francisco Peninsula serving local, seasonal and organic food.  Windows line the corner on Burlingame Avenue, bringing in daylong natural light and showcasing a comfortable front lounge, long flamed black granite bar and dining room. Burlingame Plant seats up to 80, with standing cocktail events of up to 120. The lounge and front dining area incorporates an operable glass partition allowing for small private dinner events.  With multiple connections to the public, outdoor sidewalk seating and indoor mall lounge area, the restaurant establishes an active presence in the pedestrian friendly shopping district. In addition to the main restaurant there is The Plant Café located next door with coffee and takeout service.
