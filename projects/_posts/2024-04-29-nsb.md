NextSpace Coworking Berkeley, set within the previous banking offices of the historic Chamber of Commerce building in downtown Berkeley, houses flexible office space, meeting rooms, kitchen, dining and relaxation lounges. From the solo entrepreneur to teams needing startup space, NextSpace caters to an eclectic workforce in the educational and technological hub of this east bay city. The central skylit atrium space is arranged with private offices and workspaces adjacent to social break-out team spaces. Greenery is interspersed throughout to create a loose park like layout and to help provide visual screening. Furniture and materials are colorful and set against a more muted background of historical features and details – expressing and celebrating this contrast between old and new.
