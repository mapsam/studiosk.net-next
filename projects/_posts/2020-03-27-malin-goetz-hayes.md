(Malin + Goetz) is a skincare and perfume company that creates modern, unisex products.  Their first store in San Francisco is located in the dynamic Hayes Valley neighborhood. The highlight of the space is a custom shelving system milled from structural cross-laminated timber (CLT). This renewable material was designed to the proportions of (Malin + Goetz)’s products.  The CLT shelving was CNC-milled out of solid 9” slabs then delivered to the site ready for installation, cutting down time for shop-drawing review and fabrication as the panels were fabricated prior to store build out and not reliant on field-dimensional accuracy. The material’s warmth, texture, and tactility reinforces a connection between space, product, and body.

The cash register area is adapted from a vintage Danish furniture piece, this use of adapted or found millwork is a signature element of all of M+G’s stores.  There is also a locally crafted, custom designed display case in the center of the space for specialty items.  The quality of the space is highlighted by the lighting design that draws customers deeper into the store while casting a uniform light across the products
