A remodel and addition to an existing mid-century modern house, this residence is located in wooded Portola Valley with a rural feel yet at the same time not far from the heart of Silicon Valley.  Needing a dedicated office for telecommuting as well as potential for a future bedroom as the family grows, the client wanted the addition to tie into the existing house but also be more grand spatially and connect to the expansive views of the oak woodlands and rolling hills of the site. The addition entails bedrooms, mudroom and possible future in-law unit on the ground level with vertical addition and separate office on the second level. This office and study space acts as a light gathering volume during the day and a glowing lantern in the evening. Along with natural and robust materials, generous daylighting, operable windows and connections to the landscape, the addition allows for a light filled and warm modern space of solace for family living.
